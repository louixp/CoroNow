# Frontend

This is the react package to create a webpage displaying data processed by CoroNow's core components.  

## Implementation

### Word Cloud

The word cloud will be implemented with matters.js, a javascript physics library that supports various physical attributes. We'll primarily focus on building a ball pool with inverted gravity, with each ball indicating the position of a word. Sizes of balls will be determined by how hot this word is in the latest scraping.  

### Word Trend

TODO

### Sentiments

Desired effect: when scrolling down along the page, word cloud shrinks vertically, and giving about 2/3 of the space of the whole page to sentiment results.
