# Frontend

This is the react package to create a webpage displaying data processed by CoroNow's core components.  

## Implementation

### Word Cloud

Use react-wordcloud package to create a responsive, callback-able wordcloud.  
NOTES

* big font size may lead to severe performance drop  

* gery out the background when a overlay window is in action ([resource](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9843556/how-to-grey-out-a-box-in-css/9844497>))  

### Word Trend

Use react-bootstrap to create an overlay component displaying trend information.  

### Sentiments

Desired effect: when scrolling down along the page, word cloud shrinks vertically, and giving about 2/3 of the space of the whole page to sentiment results.
